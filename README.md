# biggestben
a bot to chime in and let the user know an hour has passed and its probably time for bed

at the top of every hour the biggest ben will join the discord channel and play an audio file

It was designed to be as annoying as possible 

# env vars needed
You need to get the bot token from Discord it can be found at https://discord.com/developers/applications
Also the channel ID will need to be changed for each channel you want the bot to join
